SolarwindsMSP: SSD Data Recovery Best Practices

1. What are some common indicators that an SSD may be failing?

Bad blocks, file repair system, crashing, read only mode

2. How do SSD failures differ from HDD failures in terms of detectability?

SSD failures are more difficult to detect than HDD as they do not emit audible sounds that would indicate a problem. 

3. What are bad blocks in an SSD, and how do they affect its performance?

“Bad blocks” are storage segments that through corruption or physical damage make it harder to save and open. Saving, reading, and moving files may fail. Applications may lag or crash.


4. How can power cycling an SSD help resolve certain issues?

If the SSD becomes corrupted due to power failure, power cycling can help “reset” the issue by using specific steps in unplugging cables and turning power off and back on in specific intervals.

5. How might this topic be relevant in the aftermath of a natural disaster? Describe how individuals or      communities can use these techniques to recover data and resume their normal activities.

These are good starting points and troubleshooting ideas to try if one is experiencing a drive failure. The article also elaborates on how physical damage impacts the drive, and the importance on having a backup strategy.
