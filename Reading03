Introduction to Help Desk Support Roles

1. What role does the help desk professional play within an organization, particularly in relation to customers?
The help desk professional has a very important job as the first line of support for customers. As such, they are the “face” of an organization’s IT staff, and customers may judge the entire organization based on their experience with a help desk professional.

2. The article differentiates between hard and soft skills. In your culture or community, are there specific skills that are highly valued? How do they compare to the skills mentioned in the article?
	
In comparing the skills of a help desk professional to those of an upper-tier IT/information security specialist, there are many commonalities. While the help desk professional may have a very broad understanding of security and technology, the cybersecurity specialist may have more specific areas of expertise. Both must have good communication skills, however, the specialist’s audience would differ from that of the people-facing help desk professional.

3. Why have security skills become more important in recent years for help desk technicians?

Security skills are more important lately because criminals are attacking organizations of all sizes, and because malware is a common threat.

4. How do writing skills and critical thinking skills play a vital role in the work of help desk technicians?

Critical thinking to identify and troubleshoot issues, and writing skills to draw up reports about them.
